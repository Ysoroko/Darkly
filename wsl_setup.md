### Windows Subsystem for Linux setup:
1) Download the provided .iso image and install Oracle Virtualbox
2) Since Oracle Virtualbox doesn't support .iso files, you can convert it to a supported format ".vdi" by running the following command in the terminal
  ``` Bash
  VBoxManage convertfromraw --format VDI "Complete-path-to-ISO-file" "Complete-path-to-VDI-file"
  
  ```
  
   - You might need to install "virtualbox" package.
   - If any other dependencies are needed, the terminal line will display the corresponding message

3) Once you have your ".vdi" file, In Oracle Virtualbox, click on "New" button
