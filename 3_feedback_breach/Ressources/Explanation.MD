### Explanation:
- On this webpage we can input the name and the message
- Both fields are protected with functions which display an alert when you leave them empty
- However, there is an error in source code, function name is badly written
- If we inspect the source code, we can see the following code in HTML which represents the process of voting:

- We can manually modify these values, so that when we vote, instead of adding a note between 1 to 10, we will add our own value
- For example, if I modify the value of the voting option "2" to 999999 and then try to vote "2" for Laurie, instead of adding 2 to the average score, she will get 999999

### How to fix:
- Instead of using manual values twice from 1 to 10, we can use the position / index of the element.
- The user must not be able to modify the values he submits!
