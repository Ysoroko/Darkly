Rightnow, let's try corrupt files on the server side from an url.

On a singin page I see <</?page=smth>> that means we can try to see othe files on the server.

Let's move to the root little by little <<?page=../../>>

It popups "Wrong", but I guess it is the right way!

So we will the reach the <<etc/passwd>> like true hackers!

http://{IP}/?page=../../../../../../../etc/passwd

Here we are!
