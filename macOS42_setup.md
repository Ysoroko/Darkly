### MacOS 42 network iMacs setup:
1) Download the provided .iso image and install Oracle Virtualbox via Managed Software Center if needed.

    You can use "goinfre" if you don't have enough space on the device for the VM.
  
2) Since Oracle Virtualbox doesn't support .iso files, you can convert it to a supported format ".vdi" by running the following command in the terminal
  ``` Bash
  VBoxManage convertfromraw --format VDI "Complete-path-to-ISO-file" "Complete-path-to-VDI-file"
  
  ```

3) Once you have your ".vdi" file, In Oracle Virtualbox, click on "New" button
